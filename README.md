# sub_vizualizer
GUI that displays sub status!

Uses PySimpleGUI. 
To install:

<code>
pip install pysimplegui
</code>

or

<code>
pip3 install pysimplegui
  
</code>

This script accesses gbl.py to get variables. Currently, where this will live in the greater folder structure is TBD. It currenlty expects to be in a folder under the sub_utilities root. You can place it anywhere else if you want, but you must edit  the sys.path command at the top of viz.py to the location of gbl.py.

Broken:

~~-Value of a variable doesn't print in GUI~~

TODO:

-Create ROS subscriber and callback that dynamically subs to n topics

-Create whitelist that ignores gbl variables that we'll never care about

-Verify script's ability to get accurate gbl values. gbl.py variables likely aren't accessible by GUI unless gbl.py and GUI are   launched by the same console or something.

-GUI values output should be to the right of the checkboxes

-GUI checkboxes should have a scrollbar
